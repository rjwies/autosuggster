Auto-suggest Module for dtSearch, Solr and other search engines 

Contegra has just released a new auto-suggest search module for Solr, dtSearch and other search engines. As users begin typing search terms, auto-suggest displays a list of key phrases matching the letters entered in the search box. For the past few years auto-suggest for searching has been quite standard on e-commerce and public search sites (Ebay, Amazon, Google and Bing) that rely on previous user searches.  Business-to-business and enterprise sites and, sites with smaller audiences often do not have sufficient search history data for creating meaningful suggestions. So instead, Contegraâ€™s solution creates the list of suggested keywords by leveraging keyword extraction algorithms. The result is highly relevant query suggestions.
 
The list is derived from harvesting 10-15 of the most important keywords and phrases from each document in the collection. Auto-Suggest is compatible with all existing dtSearch indexes and generates the list of suggested terms automatically.
 
You can try it out on our demo site www.kaleidosearch.com/hldemo. Search for climate change and you will see the list of suggested terms and phrases.
